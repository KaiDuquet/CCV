# CCV
My quick implementation of Luhn's algorithm to validate official numbers, like credit-card numbers, certain government IDs, etc. <br>

In all honesty I started this project thinking it would be complex, but it was surprisingly short and sweet. I still enjoyed writing this and it adds one more tool to my knowledge.

### Build
Any C++ compiler will do the job. It was not necessary to add any Makefiles since it's literally one .cpp file. <br>
`g++ validator.cpp -o validator` with the gcc suite for example.
